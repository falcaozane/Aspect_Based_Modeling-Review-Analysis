41,5,Awesome!!,"Tried so many different brands and there was always an issue..tooo strong/too mild/too sweet..or lasting a few hrs only..some would stain ya teeth..tongue(rinsing required with waterü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) or bottle size was too small to even last a week(with no bigger size options)etc etc etc DELIGHTED to say, this is the one I'm gonna finally stick to..no issues so far..does it's 'mouthwash' job perfectlyüëçüëç phewwww....finally can move on to more interesting things......"

44,5,"Nicely packed, well product",Good to have product
45,5,Very handy and useful.,Tastes great and doesn't burn your pocket or your mouth.
46,5,Works as shown. Good taste. No burn after use.,Works as shown. Good taste. No burn after use. Has no alcohol.
47,5,Best alcohol free mouthwash,"Last time i bought a colgate plax alcohol free one ,it was overly sweet and so overpowering that even my dinner tasted all sweet in my mouth. But this product has the right balance. I have already order another bottle. Best alcohol free mouthwash"
48,5,What Others DONT SAY!!!,"Thank you Colgate for giving for a wonderful dental care product.Technically it works, but read further to know few interesting points,1)Buy 250ml over 500ml. The 500ml might be bang for buck , but the cleaning solution loses it's effect , and you can really feel the lose of pristine feel after a week use. So purchase 250ml.2)I purchased both Freshmint and Peppermint flavors . I find Freshmint flavor more soothing and refreshing and gives much cleaner breath than other flavors. It might be personal , but yet I will go with Freshmint 250ml always.Click Helpful, if you find my review useful"
49,4,"Good product, thanks amazon","Good product and my son is using it regularly, thanks amazon"
50,4,oral carr,oral care aid
51,3,Listerine is better,Not as powerful as Listerine. It doesn't have a good taste. Cleaning effect is also not good. Listerine is way better than this.
52,4,Good quality,good quality
53,4,Good,Nice
54,5,This is different,I have already tried different flavors od Plax and listerine. But this is one is really different and that is in good sense.The unique taste resides in mouth after using it for quite sometime.
55,4,Nice,Freshness
56,4,OK,Ok
57,3,Price wise cheap than local market,"The best for this price range.If price was not concern I go for Listerine. However, this is also good.Its capable of the job for which it is made and advertised.Using daily at night before sleep.Cheaper than local market at amazon."
58,4,Goid,Good
59,5,Value for money,Regular user.
60,5,It full fill the purpose,Zero percent if u r going through a sober test on ur work life daily.

65,4,Superb,Good for oral hygiene nice flower sensational breath
66,5,good,best for me . i love itüòç
67,5,Good for the price,"The taste is mild and it doesn't burn your mouth, cleaning power is decent, and for the price, it's a nice choiceüëçüèª"
68,4,Perfect,Perfect for mouth adour
69,5,Good freshness,Good freshness.. last long
70,3,Try once,"Cool clove is better than Fresh mint. Instead of purchasing pack of 3, first purchase just 1 to see whether you are comfortable with it or not."
71,3,Burns!...but less than listerine,"I don't know why companies feel the need to add so much menthol or whatever it is that tingles and burns in mouthwash and toothpaste. It says ""Doesn't burn"" but it does. I've used Listerine in the past and that was horrible. This is much better but not ideal. It's still uncomfortable for me, burns my inner cheeks a bit and I can't wait for the 30 seconds to get over.Won't be repurchasing!!"
72,4,Similar Flavor like Paste,"Flavor as same as paste, even price also high than others, decent quality."
73,4,Works,"Does what it's supposed to do, I guess. Don't like the mint burning feeling, though."
74,4,Great for freshe breath,Essential for good oral hygiene. Keeps mouth fresh through out the night by removing germs from mouth and plaque from the teeth.
75,5,Good but not the best! üêπ,"Ok first of all, everyone, no matter what should use a mouthwash!Coming to this colgate mouthwash, positive side is that it does not burn your mouth,other than that iam not sure how long it works in fighting germs!When compared to Listerine mouthwashes, i agree it burns a lot while using it, but for me Listerine works far better than Colgate.Listerine gives 12hours of freshness in just one use, but i couldn't find that long lasting freshness with colgate!But it may vary person to person."
76,4,First pakage came in damaged condition hence reordered it,Product was good what was left of it though
77,5,Best mouthwash,"Don't have the burning sensation , as all other mouthwash have, minty but don't have much minty and very fresh"
78,1,Leaves a terrible bitter taste long after usage,I don't know how are people even giving it good reviews. I couldn't believe Colgate would put out a product so bad. The bitter aftertaste was just horrendous.
79,4,"Mouth Hygiene, freshness",Mouth hygiene is very important for you health ‚Ä¶. My purpose is same
80,5,Nice product,It last only for 2-3 hours i think.... But you will not face any burn by this product
81,5,in oralcare colgate is best,vry good mouthwash.no burning sensation like listerine.colgate provides best oralcare.
82,5,No burning sensation,"I like this mouthwash as it does not have alcohol so there is no burning sensation while you use it.Flavour is good, I though mint flavour will give cool sensation but no. So people who are having sensitive tooth can use it easily.Overall I liked it and found no issues."
83,5,Nice product,I used this while im with my retainers and the good thing was there was no burning sensation of any kind.
84,5,Fresh Gr8 tasting Mouthwash.,"The most refreshing and close to natural flavour of Mouthwash available. Unlike the others some are too harsh, too chemical tasting and too mild this hits the right spots leaving you feeling really fresh and with a lovely after taste. Green Tea with a burst of Freshness.Made in Thailand and imported into India but now with the new pricing this has become as cost effective as the others off the shelf. Factor in Amazons discounts and this makes good sense for a 500ml bottle.Again, this comes down to a personal preference but I don't think this flavour will raise too many complaints. Nice !**Do let me know if you found this review Helpful. Tks."
85,2,Boring product and leaves a weird aftertaste,The freshness as others have said is not that good on top of that it leaves a very bitter taste in your mouth which doesn't go away even after gargling a few times. It's just better to go with Listerine in my opinion
86,4,Nice,Nice product
87,5,Just okay,Just okay
88,4,Value for money,"I bought it on sale, so value for money"
89,5,worth the price,great for daily use
90,5,Good,Good
91,3,ok type product from colgate,ok type product from colgateok type product from colgateok type product from colgate
92,4,Taste does not have the strength and looks adulterated,It is duplicate looks as if wateris added and two bottles are converted into three a price tag in origami is missingpl call back and check
93,5,Use it everyday!,"It wont improve your horrible garlic & onion breath but it will reduce the stench drastically. Use it In the morning After brushing, in the evening before kissing and before going to bed after brushing in the night."
94,5,Good,Good taste
95,3,Quality,Quality is so good easy to use But price is more
96,3,Good,It ok it gives nice breeth
97,4,Fresh,Make You Feel Fresh
98,3,Pretty stabdard product,Its pretty standard in every way
99,4,Very agreeable flavour,"A liitle more sting wouldnt have hurt... But the flavour is simply awesome! Colgate has hit the sweet spot with this one... Just the right amount of sweetness, neither making u feel like u drank a ton of saccharine-water, nor too hot to make ur mouth beg for water! My go-to mothwash everytime!"
100,2,Bad,Bad
101,4,It's very good for mouth fresh..... But little bit heavy burning sensation with using,Good product
102,4,Worth money spent,U may have it
103,2,Little bit costly,Costly
104,4,Good mouthwash sans alcohol,The price should be reduced by Rs 20 atleast
105,5,Best mouthwash,Best for sensitive gums
106,4,Smell Exactly same as Colgate paste,"It gave fresh smell for 1 to 2 hr, nice product, But when you hold the mouth washer for more than 10 seconds , you feel the burning sensation. This is my first mouthwash product. So I don't know about other to do compare."
107,5,Useful,Like
108,4,....,I guess it worked idk much about it i just ordered it once andthe only thing i know is my mouth feel cold for some minutesafter using it
109,5,Always good product,Good product but price is little higher than local market
110,3,Ok,Ok
111,5,A product which always in shortage.,"This is littlebit extra in colgate's any other mouthwashes, but i don't why amazon selling only one bottle in single order that also after every 4 months, as it is always in shortage. This is the reason i switched over to another brand & i am happy now."
112,4,Fit for purpose,Fit for purpose product
113,5,Minty freshness and no stinging.,"I have recently changed my dental hygiene practices. So instead of just brushing, these days I also floss. After which, i use the directed amount of mouthwash and rinse my mouth.Colgate Mouthwash doesn't burn at all and makes the mouth feel fresh and minty. It can also be used in between after meals to take away/ control bad breath and odour.I am quite sensitive to harsh mouthwashes and this did not have any stinging feeling. Would recommend this to others too."
114,5,Amazing,Used it at night and woke up with fresh breath in the morning! Dont think I need to say more.
115,4,Nice product,Good one.Go for it
116,5,Must buy!!,"My dentist recommended this to me, and the taste is much better than all the other mouthwashes that will burn your mouth.I feel this is way more effective than other brands and also other variants of colgate itself."
