9,5,Softest brush I've ever used.,My dentist recommended me brush with smaller head so that it reaches till wisdom teeth. This brush was a game changer for me. It's very soft and the grip is so good. With small head it reaches all areas. But the bristles should be a little short like the normal brushes.
10,5,Great Toothbrush with a Handy Cap!,"I recently purchased this toothbrush, and I'm impressed with its design and functionality. The fact that it comes with a cap is a game-changer for me ‚Äì it keeps the bristles clean and makes it easy to carry in my bag without worrying about hygiene. The toothbrush itself has a comfortable grip, and the bristles are gentle yet effective in cleaning. I appreciate the attention to detail in the design, and the cap is definitely a standout feature for me. If you're looking for a reliable toothbrush that also considers convenience, this is a solid choice!"

84,4,Nice option for ordinary sensitivity!,"No one should compromise with the quality of toothbrush because it‚Äôs the matter of our own oral health. This Sensitive whitening toothbrush from Oral B is a nice option for those having sensitivity issues.This toothbrush is especially made for sensitive teeth with soft bristles to avoid any pain. Another thing which makes it special is its round tip bristles, round tip ensures no harm to both our teeth and gums as compared to the sharp bristles in most of the brushes that can cause sensitivity issues. On back of the toothbrush a textured tongue cleaner is also provided but that's not a proper cleaner.One thing which you should be aware of while buying this is that although it‚Äôs soft but not an ultra-soft toothbrush. So, if you are suffering from extreme sensitivity then this is not the perfect toothbrush for you.P.S. I review products on amazon to help fellow customers in taking wise decisions and try to ensure that everyone's hard earned money get its full worth. It always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful. Feel free to comment for any queries."

89,5,Effective and Reliable Oral Care with Colgate Visible White O2 Manual Toothbrush,"**Design and Build (4/5):**The toothbrush features a sleek and ergonomic design that ensures a comfortable grip during use. The bristles are well-arranged, providing effective cleaning without causing discomfort to the gums. The overall build quality is commendable, offering durability that justifies the investment.**Performance (4.5/5):**The toothbrush lives up to its promises of preventing bad breath, cavities, enamel, and gum problems. The bristles effectively remove plaque and debris, promoting a cleaner and healthier mouth. Users may notice an improvement in the brightness of their teeth over time, contributing to the ""Visible White"" claim.**Gum Care (4/5):**Colgate Visible White O2 Manual Toothbrush is gentle on the gums, making it suitable for daily use. It effectively cleans along the gumline, aiding in the prevention of gum problems. However, individuals with sensitive gums should still exercise caution to avoid any potential irritation.**Breath Freshness (4/5):**The toothbrush helps in preventing bad breath by eliminating bacteria and food particles. Regular use, combined with proper oral hygiene practices, can contribute significantly to long-lasting freshness.**Cavity Prevention (4/5):**The toothbrush aids in cavity prevention by reaching difficult-to-access areas and removing plaque effectively. When used in conjunction with fluoride toothpaste, it provides comprehensive protection against cavities.**Enamel Protection (3.5/5):**While the toothbrush claims to protect enamel, users with particularly sensitive enamel may find the bristles slightly abrasive. It is advisable to use a gentle brushing technique to minimize the risk of enamel wear.**Value for Money (4/5):**With the package containing two toothbrushes, the product offers reasonable value for money. Considering its overall performance and effectiveness, the investment is justifiable for those seeking a reliable manual toothbrush.The Colgate Visible White O2 Manual Toothbrush is a solid choice for individuals looking to maintain good oral health. Its performance in preventing bad breath, cavities, and gum problems is commendable.

100,4,Really good and easy of use.,Very soft as said. I have been using it for quite some time now and compared to the other Colgate sensitive toothbrush I think I will prefer this as it is cheaper and does the job better than the other one. Definitely worth it.

102,5,Must Buy,"Its incredibly soft bristles make brushing a delight, perfect for sensitive gums. The effective cleaning power and ergonomic design earn it a well-deserved five-star rating. This is the second time I have bought it."
103,3,Not soft at all,"I have extremely sensitive gums and this product is advertised as ultrasoft but it's not it's the same as the others, this causes discomfort and hurts my gums, so far the only good thing good about these is that they're a little broad which mean that I don't have to shift the toothbrush up and down while brushing but that's about it, they aren't soft at all, wish I could return them"
104,4,Nice,Very soft bristles. Cleans good also . Quality is also nice . But I think it's bristles width should be decreased.
105,5,ToothBrush,It is very softAnd is also goodI like the product
106,5,Good product,I must say after a long time got a good brush. The bristles are very soft on the gums and yet do the job well. The head is big enough to fit in all corners of the mouth covers the entire mouth properly. Great product
107,4,Okay for the price,Too soft but do the job Its OK for three months maximum
108,4,Nice product,"Nice, you can go for it if you want."
109,5,Good product.,Good sturdy brushes. Bristles are neither very hard nor very soft. Just perfect for use. I'm already using the number one. Good for sustainable living. Very nice packaging.
110,4,"Great bristles, Great case","Panny, an unbiased reviewer.Comfort is very grippy to hold.Softness - It is really soft and yet able to clean your teeth because of the density of the bristles, I have had no problems so far with the bristles.The case provides a great look and easily protects it from outside, BUT the case may not last long, as it is supposed to be a bamboo case and it might start getting moisture and start to decay soon because when we put the brush inside the case, some water may leave on the toothbrush which may drip inside the case and leading to moisture buildup, which is not a problem in plastic toothbrush cases.So a great product overall, but do keep on checking inside of the case if any decay have happened or not."
111,5,Good Product,I had used this product. This is my repeat purchase as we found the product to be as required by us.
112,3,"Made in China, Non Sustainable packaging but satisfactory product","If you're goal is Sustainability and you are Indian, then do not go for this product. Let's talk on both the points :1. Sustainability - The packaging from Amazon was made using cardboard, which is good but the product CLAIMS that its own packing i.e. The box whose picture you see is also Recyclable and ""Biodegradable"". Here comes the detailed study, just like Paper cups with Plastic layering, it's the same here! There are not many recyclers can recycle through our country. So a big NO.2. Manufacture / Made in - The product is Made in People's Republic of China, and I came to learn this after the product was delivered. Now since my goal is to be sustainability too, returning this product wouldn't cost me at all, but it will definitely cost Petrol, Time and Effort of my fellow Indians. And we all know how crucial fuel costs are.Hence don't fall for it, choose Indian and Sustainable product. The displayed product is good otherwise, but the bristles are too thin and soft which might directly poke in your gums. Handle is very well made."
113,5,Buy this if you value your money and teeth,"I started using my first brush in Jan 14 and today on April 14 i am swtiching to my second brush as you can see from the photos the bristles are only slightly frayed ....thats after 3 months of use and thats just durability the real appeal is the softness of this brush... I have used Colgate,Oral-B and even dentists recommended soft brushes but all of them when you use them for the first time tend to hurt your gums but this didn't since they are made from natural material in addition to being eco friendly the soft and thin bristles go into all the crevixs of the teeth while not hurting the gums... all in all this is amazing i have recommended this to my entire family and i bough a second box just recently....100% worth every paise."
114,4,Good Product,The media could not be loaded.Very Handy To Use And soft feel on teeth
115,5,Best,Just go for it
116,1,Beware of Fungus: Rusabl Organic Bamboo Toothbrush,"I wanted to do my part for the environment, so I tried the Rusabl Organic Bamboo Toothbrush. Sadly, my experience was far from pleasant. After just a month of use, I noticed fungus growing on the wooden handle.Using a toothbrush with fungus is not hygienic and could be harmful to our oral health. I really wanted this eco-friendly option to work, but it let me down. I regret buying the Rusabl Organic Bamboo Toothbrush due to the fungus issue. Until the company fixes this problem, I cannot recommend this toothbrush to others. Our oral hygiene is essential, so it's best to choose a toothbrush without such problems."
117,3,"Good, but expensive",Expensive
118,4,Good,Good product
